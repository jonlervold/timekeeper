# TimeKeeper

TimeKeeper is a duration calculator designed for aiding in keeping track of total hour counts spent on an activity/project. The current functionality will soon be implemented into a larger system that will allow the user to log these hour counts as entries in a database, then calculate totals based on entered dates and visualize how they compare against stated goals.
